# Timeline Express - v1.2
This repository is a re-factor of the original code base.


### Custom Announcement Template
In version 1.2 users can now customize the announcement container for each announcement on the timeline.

Copy over `lib/public/partials/timeline-express-container.php` into your theme root, in a `timeline-express` directory (`wp-content/themes/theme_name/timeline-express/timeline-express-container.php`), and start customizing.
